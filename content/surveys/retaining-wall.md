> Our non-intrusive GPR surveys can determine the construction detail and thickness and identify defects in retaining walls. Typically, access is only required on one side.

## Retaining walls

Retaining walls are common along roads, motorways, and railway lines, especially in hilly and mountainous regions. They are usually reinforced concrete or masonry (brick or stone) construction. They are usually taken for granted, receiving little or no routine inspection or maintenance unless they show signs of distress, such as bulging or cracking.

## Site survey

Sandberg can undertake a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) non-intrusive survey of masonry and concrete retaining walls to determine:

- Construction detail
- Profile wall thickness
- Identify voids and other defects
- Locate features behind the retaining wall

GPR requires access to one side only. Scanning at regular intervals, both longitudinally and vertically, can produce section profiles through the wall construction. Vertical scans will identify any taper or steps in wall thickness with the height of the wall. Longitudinal scans will identify lateral changes in thickness and can detect the presence of buttresses or counterforts along the back of the retaining wall.
