> Sometimes, all you need is a simple on-site mark-up survey to locate concrete reinforcing bars, tendons, services, etc., so you can drill or cut safely. Our GPR surveys offer deeper penetration and better resolution than Ferroscan or Cover Meter.

## On-site mark-up surveys

We use Ground Penetrating Radar to detect, locate and map rebar, tendons, underfloor heating pipes, voids, and other features within concrete. For these surveys, the best results are obtained with off-site data post-processing, analysis, interpretation and full reporting. However, what if you need a quick survey to determine the position of concrete reinforcing bars, tendons or underfloor heating pipes? Our site mark-up surveys are perfect for these occasions. Suitable for walls, floors or columns, site mark-up surveys are ideal if intrusive work is planned, meaning that the contractor knows exactly where to avoid when drilling.

Our GPR surveyors are trained in-house and have considerable site experience. This experience and expert knowledge mean that we offer a reliable and quality service, helping to reduce the risk of s costly and disruptive strikes during cutting and drilling to an absolute minimum.

Although site mark-up surveys usually involve small local areas (e.g. for a single fixing or slab penetration), they can also be used for larger areas if required.

## Survey deliverables

No off-site data processing is generally required for site mark-up surveys. Our surveyor inspects the GPR data in real-time using the display screen on the GPR control unit. The position of detected features is picked up in the data, and their position is marked up in situ using chalk, engineers' crayons, or paint.

## The advantages of GPR for on-site mark-up surveys

Ground Penetrating Radar detects changes in the subsurface; therefore, it will detect metallic and non-metallic features, making it suitable for detecting and locating many sub-surface objects.

High-frequency GPR offers several advantages over other, more traditional methods, such as Cover Meter and Ferroscan:

- Greater depth penetration.
- Higher resolution.
- Typically, GPR can resolve two layers of reinforcement.
- Will detect non-metallic features such as plastic pipes or conduits.
- Small scanning head available, allowing scanning to within 45 mm of an obstruction.
