> Do you need to determine wall thickness or construction detail? Only have access to one side? We can help. Our non-intrusive GPR surveys can provide wall thickness readings and detect construction detail and variations within walls.

## Determining wall thickness

Traditionally, the thickness is determined by direct measurement; however, this requires access to both sides or coring through the wall. But what if this is not possible? What if the building is listed, there are party wall ownership issues, or you simply donâ€™t want to damage finishes? What are the options?

Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) offers a solution to this problem. It is suitable for most (non-metallic) materials, e.g. masonry, brick and concrete. GPR can determine the thickness of several layers of construction, e.g. render thickness and wall thickness, determine the likely construction detail, and detect variations in construction.

## GPR wall surveys

Our NDT GPR surveys are particularly useful for determining the following:

- Wall thickness
- Party wall surveys
- Swimming pool wall surveys
- Wall construction detail

GPR scans continuously record thickness information along a scan line, effectively providing a cross-section through the subsurface. This makes GPR especially suitable for detecting variations in thickness and changes in construction detail.

An additional benefit of using GPR is that other information can be collected at the same time, such as reinforcement distribution, depth of cover to rebar, delamination between layers, [embedded metal in masonry](/surveys/locate-metal-in-masonry/), [void location](/surveys/void-location/), etc.

## Advantages of GPR wall thickness surveys

Sandberg offers GPR surveys to determine the thickness of construction. Our experienced surveyors can undertake anything from simple spot readings to extensive and comprehensive surveys of large areas to determine the thickness of construction and variations in thickness. Advantages of using GPR include:

- Access to one side only required
- Non-intrusive
- Suitable for most non-metallic materials
- Minimal disruption, can be carried out in occupied premises
- Suitable for large or small areas
- Clean and no noise
- Quick and cost-effective

##Party wall surveys

A party wall divides the buildings of two owners. This boundary is usually positioned at the centre of the wall; however, this is not always the case.

Because different buildings and owners are involved, physical measurement of wall thicknesses can be very difficult, if not impossible.

GPR offers a quick and effective non-intrusive survey method for determining the thickness of walls. It is suitable for both concrete and solid masonry. GPR will also detect any wall protrusions, columns, and chimney breasts on the other side of the wall. Results can be marked onto CAD drawings or annotated on radargrams showing a pseudo-section view of the surveyed wall.

## Survey deliverables

Results can be marked on CAD drawings as spot readings, contour plots, or colour-coded thickness zones along scan lines.
