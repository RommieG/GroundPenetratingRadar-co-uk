## The basic components of a GPR system

Ground Penetrating Radar equipment is usually modular and generally comprises two main components:

A control unit, usually with a rechargeable battery to power the system.
An antenna, comprising a transmitter and receiver to transmit and receive the reflected signal pulse.

Compact all-in-one systems are also available; however, as they are fixed, they cannot be modified to suit different types of surveys.

For a successful GPR site survey, we firmly believe that the survey must be conducted by a suitably trained and experienced surveyor using the most appropriate GPR equipment available.

The core of our equipment pool that we use daily includes, but is not limited to, the following:

## GPR Control units

The control unit contains the electronics that generate and control the GPR pulse of electromagnetic energy waves that the system’s antenna sends into the sub-surface.

The control unit also includes an in-built computer, although some systems use an external laptop. This saves the GPR data generated by the antenna’s receiver on a hard drive or solid-state memory.

Most control units include an integral display unit, which enables a visual means of configuring the system for the survey. It also displays the GPR data in real-time, enabling preliminary interpretation on-site. This helps to ensure that the survey objectives are being met. More detailed analysis is undertaken off-site by uploading the saved data files and using specialist software to process and interpret the data.

### GSSI SIR 4000 control unit

The SIR4000 is a GPR data acquisition system and control unit from GSSI designed to operate with analogue and digital antennas, including the latest dual frequency antennas. Other improvements over the SIR3000, which it replaces, include advanced display modes and filtering capabilities for ‘in the field’ processing and imaging.

### GSSI SIR 3000 control unit

### GSSI SIR 30 multi-channel control unit

{{< assetimage "images/about/equipment-sir30.jpg"
"" 
"The GSSI SIR 30 control unit">}}

The SIR-30 from GSSI is a multi-channel GPR system offering a number of advantages over single-channel systems such as the SIR-3000. As the name suggests, multi-channel allows several antennas to be used simultaneously; in the case of the SIR-30, up to 4 (although you can piggyback two units, giving a total of 8 channels). The SIR-30 also offers real-time data processing, including migration, surface positioning, signal floor tracking and adaptive background removal.

It is ideal for high-speed data collection to measure pavement layer thickness, detect cavities, assess airport runways, detect fouled/clean ballast, and detect utilities.

## GPR antennas

The antenna is the system's second key Ground Penetrating Radar equipment component. It comprises a transmitter and receiver. The receiver sends the GPR signal from the control unit into the subsurface as a series of pulses. Changes and features within the subsurface produce reflections. The receiver receives these reflections, together with amplitude information and time-travel information. The data is sent back to the control unit, where it is saved electronically and, for most systems, displayed on an integral screen.

GPR scans can be undertaken using antennas with different central frequencies. The resolution and detail of GPR data increase with higher antenna frequencies; however, the depth of penetration decreases. As a general rule, it is desirable to use the highest frequency possible while still meeting the objectives of the survey. When undertaking site surveys, we carry a range of antennas that may be suitable for the conditions likely to be encountered. This enables us to select the most suitable antenna for the survey. We often scan using multiple frequencies to ensure the best possible data is recorded.

### GSSI 300/800 MHz dual-frequency antenna

{{< assetimage "images/about/equipment-df-antenna.jpg"
"" 
"The GSSI 300/800 MHz dual-frequency antenna">}}

The 300/800 MHz dual-frequency (DF) antenna records two sets of data (one for each antenna frequency), enabling shallow and deeper targets to be detected at optimum resolution. The resolution and detail of GPR scan data decrease with lower antenna frequencies; it is, therefore, desirable to use the highest frequency possible while still meeting the survey objectives. The data can be merged using Radan software to display both sets of data in a merged file, making data analysis and interpretation easier and more efficient.

#### Specification

- Centre Frequencies: 300 and 800 MHz
- Penetration Depth: up to 4m
- Uses: utility surveys, archaeology, deep construction detail
- Manufactured by: GSSI

#### Uses

Typical applications for the 300/800 MHz dual-frequency antenna include:

- Retaining wall surveys
- Void location in construction and below slabs

## All-in-one GPR systems

There is an increasing number of all-in-one GPR systems available. These typically house the control unit, antenna and power supply all in one unit. Because the component parts are all fixed, the main advantage of these systems is that they are mostly pre-configured and, hence, simple to use. They are, however, also very limiting. As the component parts are fixed, they lack versatility, and components can’t be interchanged to suit site and survey conditions. For this reason, they tend to be one-trick ponies and are designed for a specific survey type.

### GSSI UtilityScan DF

{{< assetimage "images/about/equipment-utilityscan.jpg"
"" 
"The GSSI UtilityScan DF">}}

The GSSI UtilityScan DF is a dual-frequency GPR system designed for utility location. It features a digital dual-frequency antenna (300 and 800 MHz), allowing shallow and deep targets to be detected simultaneously with a single pass of the antenna. This reduces time on site whilst at the same time improving utility detection rate.

#### Data Display

The UtilityScan DF has several modes to view the data in real-time during data collection:

- Split View – allows the two channels to be viewed simultaneously, aligned one above the other.
- Blend Mode: This displays a multi-frequency data fusion in real-time, combining the high-resolution near-surface data (800 MHz) with the lower depth detail (300 MHz) in a single view

#### Flexibility

Although the UtilityScan DF is primarily designed for utility surveys, we are finding it useful for other GPR surveys, such as:

- Detection of underground obstructions
- Locating underground voids, especially under concrete or asphalt pavements
- Burial sites
- Geological investigation
- Archaeology
