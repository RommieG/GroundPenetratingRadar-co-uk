We were instructed to undertake a structural survey of a warehouse floor slab for back analysis of the slab to determine its load capacity.

The following information was required from the survey:

- The thickness of the slab
- Reinforcement size (from breakouts)
- Pile locations of the piles
- Punching shear reinforcement above the piles

The above photo shows a GPR surveyor scanning the whole floor slab to map the slab thickness, locate piles, and determine the general reinforcement layout. Detailed scanning on regular orthogonal grids with scans at 100mm centres was also undertaken to determine the punching shear reinforcement above several previously located piles.

We used GSSI SIR 3000 and 4000 control units and 2.6 GHz and 1.5 GHz antennas for this survey.

The site survey was completed in under a day. A preliminary check of the data indicated that we had all the information the client required for their calculations. More detailed data analysis and interpretation were undertaken off-site. Results were presented in a factual report.
